//  Right now the I have been testing with only one currency, so the only configuration that works is Ethereum, ethermine.org
//  You will need an address to test, I have been using: CAbe2896FeB48a8f1E98d23d7505da426a46eDaA
//  More addresses can be found at: https://ethermine.org/ under "Recently mined blocks
//  As  you can see, I have CrptyoCompare api, the Ethermine, the Chart library, and a QR code generator. You can scan the QR code gen and the actual address will showup!
// I am still missing the kraken api but i think that I am going to focus on the mining aspect over the trading ascpect.
// Thanks for giving some extra time to work on this (Milestone 3)
